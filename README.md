# Object Detection for Traffic Cameras

## 📘 Project Overview
Traffic congestion and road safety are two major challenges faced by modern cities. While traffic cameras are commonly used for monitoring, manually analyzing video footage is time-consuming and often inaccurate.  
This project aims to develop an automated system that can detect and classify objects such as cars, buses, bikes, and pedestrians from traffic camera footage in real time.  

By using **Python**, **OpenCV**, and **YOLO (You Only Look Once)** — a deep learning model for object detection — the system will identify multiple objects simultaneously, helping to improve efficiency and safety in traffic monitoring.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Automatically detect and classify vehicles and pedestrians from traffic camera footage.  
- Improve accuracy and reduce manual monitoring effort.  
- Explore the use of computer vision techniques for smart city applications.

## 🧰 Tools and Technologies (Planned)
- **Python 3.10+**  
- **OpenCV** for video frame processing  
- **YOLOv8** for object detection  
- **NumPy / Matplotlib** for data handling and visualization  

## 📅 Current Status
🟢 *Phase 1 – Conception Phase*  
The project topic and approach have been defined. The next step will involve implementing the solution and testing the object detection model in **Phase 2 (Development Phase)**.
