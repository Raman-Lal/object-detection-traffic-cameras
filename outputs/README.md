# Outputs Folder

This folder contains all output files generated by the object detection script.  
Each run of the system creates a set of artifacts that can be used for evaluation, reporting, and further analysis.

The following types of outputs are stored here:

---

## 1. Annotated Video  
If an output video path is provided, the system saves a processed video where each detected object is marked with:

- a bounding box,
- a class label (car, bus, person, etc.),
- and a confidence score.

This video helps visualise how the model performed on the full sequence.

Example (not included in repository):
```
outputs/output_video.mp4
```

Note: Large video files are not included in this repository.

---

## 2. CSV Results (Per-Frame Detection Log)  
After each run, the system generates a CSV file with detailed detection counts for every frame.  
Typical columns include:

- `frame`
- number of cars
- number of buses
- number of trucks
- number of motorcycles
- number of bicycles
- number of pedestrians
- total detections in that frame
- timestamp (approx.)

Example:
```
outputs/results.csv
```

This file is used for evaluation, graph creation, and performance comparison.

---

## 3. Detection Graph  
A graph showing total detections per frame is generated automatically.  
This provides an overview of traffic density patterns and model performance across the video.

Example:
```
outputs/detections_graph.png
```

The graph is useful for the final report and demonstrates how object counts change over time.

---

## 4. Screenshots (Annotated Frames)  
During detection, the script saves periodic screenshots (for example, every 50 frames).  
Each screenshot is an annotated frame showing all detected objects at that moment.

Files are stored in:
```
outputs/screenshots/
```

These images are useful for documentation, reports, and visual comparison.

---

## Important Notes  
- Only small files such as screenshots, CSV logs, and the graph are included in the repository.  
- Large output videos are not uploaded due to GitHub storage limitations.  
- Users running the script locally will generate new outputs automatically.

This folder provides all evidence needed to analyse system performance and verify detection accuracy across different test videos.
